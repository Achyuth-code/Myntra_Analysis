## üìä Project Overview

The **Myntra Product Analysis** project aims to explore and analyze product data from Myntra, a leading online fashion and lifestyle retailer. The goal is to gain insights into product ratings, pricing strategies, discounts, and brand performance. This analysis can help understand consumer preferences, pricing trends, and the effectiveness of promotional strategies.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview

- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from Myntra‚Äôs product listings, possibly through web scraping or available datasets.

### Key Features:

1. **product_name**: Name of the product.
2. **brand_name**: Brand of the product.
3. **rating**: Average rating of the product (e.g., 4.5).
4. **rating_count**: Number of ratings the product has received.
5. **marked_price**: Original price of the product before any discounts.
6. **discounted_price**: Price of the product after applying discounts.
7. **sizes**: Available sizes for the product (e.g., S, M, L).
8. **product_link**: URL to the product page on Myntra.
9. **img_link**: URL to the product image.
10. **product_tag**: Tags associated with the product (e.g., "summer collection").
11. **brand_tag**: Tags associated with the brand (e.g., "premium").
12. **discount_amount**: Amount of discount applied to the product.
13. **discount_percent**: Percentage of discount applied to the product.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Main programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and creating charts.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

## üìà Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing product ratings and rating counts to determine top-rated products.
   - Examining pricing trends, including marked prices, discounted prices, and discount amounts.
   - Exploring brand performance and discount strategies.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Creating visualizations to compare ratings, discounts, and pricing across different brands and product categories.
   - Visualizing the distribution of product prices and discounts.
4. **Insights Generation**:
   - Identifying popular products and brands based on ratings and sales.
   - Analyzing the impact of discounts on product pricing and sales performance.

## üìä Key Insights

- **Top Rated Products**: Highlight products with the highest average ratings.
- **Discount Analysis**: Explore the relationship between discount percentage and discounted price.
- **Brand Performance**: Analyze which brands offer the highest discounts or have the most popular products.
- **Pricing Trends**: Understand how the marked price and discounted price vary across different product categories.
